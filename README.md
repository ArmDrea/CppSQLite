# CppSQLite

A simple and easy-to-use cross-platform C++ wrapper for the SQLite API, distributed as a simple .cpp/.h pair that you can "just include" in your projects.

This is a fork of the original CppSQLite project, originally by Rob Groves, currently updated and maintained by NeoSmart Technologies.
